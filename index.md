## About Me as a CS Student

<img src="./images/logoMui.png" align="right" width="10%">

As written previously, I am a 3rd year student studying Computer Science. I'm in Muir college. I also love math (I was originally a math major)! I am still figuring out what I want to focus on in Computer Science. Some areas I am currently interested in are security, cryptography, and machine learning.

During summer 2021, I worked as a STEP intern at Google. My project used `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` on the frontend and `Java` and `SQL` on the backend. I learned a lot, and hope to return in the future.

## About Me Personally

### Sports
I like running and play a little bit of tennis and soccer.

### Books
I enjoy reading a lot. My favorite book is Kurt Vonnegut's *Slaughterhouse-Five*.

\- Kurt Vonnegut, Slaughterhouse-Five

### Music
I played the viola as a kid, and have been playing the electric guitar for about a year.

I also like listening to rock/alternative/hip-hop music. If I had to pick a favorite song, it would probably be ["At the Door"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CAz_vvsK9M) from  *The New Abnormal*.

### Games
I like to play video games, but don't have as much time anymore. One of my favorite series is the Dark Souls trilogy.
